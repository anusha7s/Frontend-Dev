        <strong>Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.</strong>
        <br>It involves training models on large datasets to identify patterns and relationships, allowing the
        models to improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.
        <br><em>Machine Learning is widely used in various applications, including image and speech recognition,
        natural language processing, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles, among others.</em>
        <mark>Overall, Machine Learning plays a crucial role in advancing technology and enabling intelligent systems
        that can adapt and respond to changing environments and user needs</mark>
        <br><small>As a Machine Learning enthusiast, I am passionate about exploring the latest advancements in this field and applying them to solve real-world problems.</small>
